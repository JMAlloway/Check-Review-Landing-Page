Build a single-page React landing page for CheckGuard by ClearLedger Technologies, LLC (getcheckguard.com) - a check review SaaS platform for community banks.

## Brand & Tone
- Professional, trustworthy fintech aesthetic (think: Plaid, Treasury Prime, Unit)
- Navy blue (#1e3a5f) and forest green (#2d5a3d) primary palette with white/light gray backgrounds
- Clean, modern typography (Inter or similar)
- Convey security, compliance, and operational efficiency
- NO generic stock photo vibes - use abstract geometric patterns or subtle grid/ledger motifs

## Hero Section
Headline: "Check Review That Actually Works for Community Banks"
Subhead: "Stop drowning in manual check reviews. CheckGuard gives your ops team the speed of automation with the control regulators demand."

Include a "Request Demo" CTA button that scrolls to the form.

## Pain Points Section (3 cards)
1. "Inconsistent Decisions" - Different reviewers, different standards. Examiners notice.
2. "No Audit Trail" - When regulators ask why you approved that check, can you show them?
3. "Drowning in Volume" - Your team reviews hundreds of items daily with spreadsheets and gut feel.

## Solution Section
Brief paragraph: CheckGuard is a human-in-the-loop check review console built specifically for community banks. Your team makes every decision - we just make those decisions faster, more consistent, and audit-ready.

## Features Grid (6 items with icons)
1. Bank-Grade Image Viewer - Zoom, pan, magnifier, brightness controls. See what you need to see.
2. Side-by-Side Comparison - Compare against historical checks from the same account instantly.
3. Dual Control Workflows - Configurable thresholds for two-person approval. Your policy, enforced automatically.
4. Full Audit Trail - Every action logged, timestamped, immutable. Evidence-sealed for examiner requests.
5. Explainable Detection Rules - When something's flagged, your team knows exactly why.
6. Works With Your Core - Flat file imports, SFTP, or API. We adapt to your infrastructure, not the other way around.

## Trust Section
- "Built for banks under $10B that can't afford enterprise pricing but can't afford examiner findings either."
- Bullet points: SOC 2 Type II (in progress), FFIEC-aligned controls, BSA/AML workflow support, Multi-tenant isolation
